# Welcome

I am currently a student at [Olivet Nazarene University](https://olivet.edu) (grad May 2022) working towards my Bachelors in Computer Science Software Entrepreneurship with minors in Cyber Security Defense and Business. Along side being a student at Olivet, I am also a student web developer for both [IT - Information Systems](https://it.olivet.edu) and [Benner Library - Informatics](https://library.olivet.edu).

## Current Projects
  I am currently working on two projects for Olivet, ([Shine Donations](https://securepayment.olivet.edu) and [Benner Library Website](https://library.olivet.edu)), and a personal project ([My Personal Site](https://colearseneau.com)).
